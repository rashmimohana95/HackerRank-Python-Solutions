We define super digit of an integer  using the following rules:
Given an integer, we need to find the super digit of the integer.
* If x has only 1 digit, then its super digit is x.
* Otherwise, the super digit of x is equal to the super digit of the sum of the digits of x.
For example, the super digit of  will be calculated as:
	super_digit(9875)   	9+8+7+5 = 29 
	super_digit(29) 	2 + 9 = 11
	super_digit(11)		1 + 1 = 2
	super_digit(2)		= 2  
Example
n= '9875'
k = 4
The number p is created by concatenating the string n k times so the initial p = 9875987598759875.
